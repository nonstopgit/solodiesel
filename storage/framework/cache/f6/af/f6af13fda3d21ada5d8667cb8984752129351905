		<p>The key part of the SoloDiesel cap, which reliably prevents misfuelling, includes five safety latches, which recognize the diameter of the fuel nozzle.</p>
		<p>In case you attempt to insert a narrower petrol nozzle into a wider diesel fuel aperture, SoloDiesel will prevent this by means of the above-mentioned safety latches and block the petrol nozzle.

		<p>Have you every watched Formula 1 races and noticed quick refuelling of the racing car without having to unscrew or screw the fuel cap during short pits stops?</p>
		<p>Even the SoloDiesel cap having the primary function of preventing misfuelling the wrong (petrol) fuel into diesel-fuelled vehicles has a similar flap system. Once we insert the fuel nozzle into the aperture, the flap removes, when we pull the fuel nozzle out, the flap automatically closes.</p>

		<p><h4>When fuelling becomes – comfortable</h4></p>
		<p>The SoloDiesel cap is made in accordance with European standards and reliably prevents putting of petrol fuel into a diesel tank aperture. However, the SoloDiesel cap also has other advantages, which guarantee comfortable fuelling.</p>
		<p>The manufacturer of SoloDiesel has made sure that their misfuelling prevention device suits nearly all models of car manufacturers thanks to seven models of thread and funnel caps. We no longer need the original cap, as once the SoloDiesel cap is installed to the filler neck with a few simple moves, it remains there. Namely, the movable flap on the cap prevents fuel from leaking out.</p>
		
		<p><h4>Quick and clean</h4></p>
		<p>SoloDiesel at the same time enables quick and »clean« fuelling without possibly getting your hands dirty by screwing or unscrewing the cap. Fuelling is therefore more simple and faster, whereas your hands don’t smell of petrol. Just simply insert the nozzle, which will surely prevent misfuelling, into the aperture by gently pushing the flap and start fuelling. Once you pull out the nozzle, the flap closes again tightly.</p>
		
		<p><h4>Economical misfuelling prevention cap</h4></p>
		<p>European statistics reveal 900 million euros of car repair costs as a result of misfuelling on annual basis. However, we should not disregard additional 100 million euros of costs, which include lease of a replacement vehicle and losses resulting from owner’s reorganization while his or her car is being repaired, as showed in misfuelling statistics.</p>
		
		<p><h4>SoloDiesel also protects the environment</h4></p>
		<p>Nonetheless, the SoloDiesel misfuelling prevention cap also relieves the environment and protects nature from additional pollution. Only in Great Britain, 7.5 million litres of unusable mixture of diesel and petrol fuel as a result of misfuelling are annually discarded, but the use of SoloDiesel will undoubtedly decrease this quantity to a great extent.</p>
		<p>The SoloDiesel cap offers protection from putting a petrol in diesel car to newer and older diesel car models, even vehicles manufactured before 1980. In our <a href="/vehicle-list">vehicle list</a> is more than 150 model cars.</p>

		<p><h4>Insurance companies reimburse for only a part of costs</h4></p>
		<p>Insurance companies are mostly not in favour of the reimbursement of costs arising from misfuelling. They certainly don’t cover such expenses resulting from pumping of fuels, replacement of fuel cleaners, cleaning of fuel supply system and possible major damages to the engine and fuel supply system elements.</p>
		<p>With the SoloDiesel cap it is not important how your vehicle is insured, because misfuelling is a thing of the past.</p>
